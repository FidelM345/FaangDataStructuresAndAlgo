# FAANG ðŸ“œDatastructures and ðŸ›£Algorithms Practice Questions. (Project is still under development. It will be updated Daily)
> **About** <br>In this repo I highlight some of the commonly asked questions in the **FAANG** companies' interviews. FAANG
stands for (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google). The questions are not only limited to the 5 mentioned
companies, but they are also commonly asked by other FAANG like companies such as Microsoft, PayPal, IBM etc.
In short, most top software companies tend to use this kind of **DS and Algorithms** questions
> to determine the candidate who is technically fit for their software engineering roles.
> <br> In the project, I have solved each of the questions using both the Brute force and optimal method.
> This will help you better understand the techniques of both implementing and improving your 
> Algorithm solution.<br> <br>

## ðŸ—ƒProject structure
> The Languages used for solving the **DS and Algorithm** questions are: **Java and Kotlin**

The main branch contains and empty **Main** class and a **README** file outlining the general structure of the project.
To access the questions switch to your branch of choice. Each branch represent a single data structure and algorithm 
question. For example, the branch called **Arrays** will contain only the array questions. Below is a list of **Topics**
(branches) covered in this project: <br>
* Arrays
* Strings
* Linked List
* Binary Trees
* Queues
* Stacks
* Recursion
* And many more ðŸ˜€
