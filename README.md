# FAANG ğŸ“œDatastructures and ğŸ›£Algorithms Practice Questions.
> **About** <br>In this repo I highlight some of the commonly asked questions in the **FAANG** companies' interviews. FAANG
stands for (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google). The questions are not only limited to the 5 mentioned
companies, but they are also commonly asked by other FAANG like companies such as Microsoft, PayPal, IBM etc.
In short, most top software companies tend to use this kind of **DS and Algorithms** questions
> to determine the candidate who is technically fit for their software engineering roles.
> <br> In the project, I have solved each of the questions using both the Brute force and optimal method.
> This will help you better understand the techniques of both implementing and improving your 
> Algorithm solution.<br> <br>
